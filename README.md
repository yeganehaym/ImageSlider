# ImageSlider
An ImageView act as slideshow by fade in and fade out effects
supports Bitmap[] and Resource drawables[] as input params

use from "SetMinShowtime" and "SetMaxShowtime" to provide a random time between these two numbers to show us each image
the unit is ms
the default value for both is 3000ms and each image will displays 3000ms
it will be good when you use Imageslider in gridview and all imagesliders wont change their images on once time and 
changing will be mess.

KeepSquare Method (default value is false) will keep your images dimenssions fixed as squar images.
it will be good when you use ImageSlider in gridview.
